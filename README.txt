This document will include some useful instructions to implement our project's code.

In the fold named 'Group14_STATS402_Code', there are several files. 
The important files are
1. STATS402_Final_project_Code_part.ipynb (The main code of our project)
2. ob_sample.jpg (which is a stored image to show our dataset)
3. Some images used for testing

After preparing these files, we also need to add our pertained models and preprocessed dataset (pickle file) to the folder. The link for downloading the preprocessed dataset and pretrained models can be found in this link:

Please download all the files in the google drive folder(Group14 STATS402 Final Project) and save them to the 'Group14_STATS402_Code' folder. There are 4 pickle files and two 'h5' files in total.

After getting these files, open Jupiter notebook and make sure essential packages are installed in the python environment(especially opencv, using 'pip install opencv-contrib-python' for installation). Then run all the cells.

In short, the instructions are
1. Download all the files in the google drive and save them in the folder.
2. Open the STATS402_Final_project_Code_part.ipynb and run all cells.
